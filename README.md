# Neural Network Classification for Employee Attrition

## Project Scope

This project aims to predict the attrition of employees using a neural network classification model built with TensorFlow. The goal is to identify patterns in employee characteristics that lead to attrition and use this information to predict whether an employee is at risk of leaving the organization.

## Objectives

- Identify the factors driving employee attrition.
- Build a neural network classification model to predict employee attrition.

## Data

The dataset contains demographic details, work-related metrics, and an attrition flag.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run `main.py` to execute the project.

## Requirements

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
